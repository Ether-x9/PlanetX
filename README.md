**WARNING**: This is an _extreme_ work-in-progress. Major bugs are to be expected, and some things aren't at all finished yet.

Anyway, this is a mod that aims to add an analog for the hypothetical Planet Nine into KSP. So far it contains one gas giant, Tempest, orbiting ten times farther out than even Eeloo. Tempest doesn't have any moons yet, but they'll be added soon.

Licensed ARR, will change once I decide to make an official release
